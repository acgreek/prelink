- undo mode
- handle hardlinks to executables/binaries
  (currently, if say /usr/bin/gcc and /usr/bin/gcc3 are hardlinked
   together, prelink will pick up the first one which it will prelink
   and will leave /usr/bin/gcc3 as different file (and not prelinked).
   For hardlinks within the same directory I think prelink could just
   search that directory and link(2) the files afterwards, for hardlinks
   not within one directory, it would basically need:
   - canonicalize_file_name early
   - if already in cache, but with different canonicalized filename,
     create a special link-me-after entry in cache
   - process them afterwards)
- hack up other modes of operation than -a, allow specifying of
  files/binaries on the command line rather than in config file
- check all libraries brought in because of dependencies, if they would
  be in the prelinking directories (so that one can e.g. disallow prelinking
  libraries on NFS mounted filesystems etc.)
- security audit:
  - should we only limit prelinking in non-world writeable directories
  - or should it use O_EXCL for creation of *.#prelink# files
- see what needs to be done in relocate_dso about stabs and dwarf2
- more ports
- hack support for multi-ABI arches
- more testing
