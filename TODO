- undo mode
- hack up other modes of operation than -a, allow specifying of
  files/binaries on the command line rather than in config file
- check all libraries brought in because of dependencies, if they would
  be in the prelinking directories (so that one can e.g. disallow prelinking
  libraries on NFS mounted filesystems etc.)
- security audit:
  - should we only limit prelinking in non-world writeable directories
  - or should it use O_EXCL for creation of *.#prelink# files
- dwarf2 (and perhaps dwarf) support for adjust_dso
- more ports
- hack support for multi-ABI arches
- more testing
